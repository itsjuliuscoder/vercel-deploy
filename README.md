## CI/CD Pipeline

This project includes a robust CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions that automates the build, test, and deployment processes.

### Pipeline Structure

1. **Staging Workflow** (.github/workflows/staging.yaml)
   - Triggered on:
     - Push to the `develop` branch
     - Pull requests to `main` or `develop` branches
     - Manual trigger via GitHub interface
   - Creates preview deployments for all changes
   - For PRs, adds a comment with the preview URL

2. **Production Workflow** (.github/workflows/production.yaml)
   - Triggered on:
     - Push to the `main` branch
     - Manual trigger via GitHub interface
   - Deploys the application to production

### Setting Up the Pipeline

To use the CI/CD pipeline, you need to add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:

1. `VERCEL_TOKEN`: Your Vercel authentication token
2. `VERCEL_ORG_ID`: Your Vercel organization ID
3. `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`: Your Vercel project ID

#### Getting Vercel Credentials

1. Install the Vercel CLI and log in:
```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel login
```

2. Link your project to Vercel:
```bash
vercel link
```

3. Get your project information:
```bash
vercel whoami  # Get your user and team IDs
vercel project ls  # Get your project ID
```

4. Generate a token from the Vercel dashboard: Settings â†’ Tokens

### Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `develop` for your work
2. Make changes and create a PR to `develop`
3. The staging workflow will build and deploy a preview
4. After review, merge into `develop` for staging deployment
5. When ready for production, create a PR from `develop` to `main`
6. After review, merge into `main` for production deployment

## Contributing

2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
